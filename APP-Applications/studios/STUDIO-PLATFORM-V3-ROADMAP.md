# nLab Studio Platform V3 — implementation roadmap

Status: **IMPLEMENTATION IN PROGRESS**  
Source of truth for public Studio inventory: `APP-Applications/studios/catalog.json`

## Architectural rules

1. **Responsive by contract** — every Studio and derived app must support phone, tablet, desktop and wide desktop layouts from the shared Core.
2. **One engine, many consumers** — reusable processing lives in shared engines/services; Studios orchestrate it and provide the advanced UX.
3. **Quick capability + escalation** — business apps and other Studios may expose a simplified capability and route advanced work to the specialized Studio.
4. **Derived apps are capability subsets** — a mini-app such as PDF Sign must reuse the parent Studio engine/services, not fork them.
5. **No mutable release metadata in UI source** — version/channel/commit/date are resolved from the canonical registry and Git/build metadata.
6. **Read-only gallery** — Studio/asset/demo galleries are projections. Editable sources remain canonical files.
7. **Common assets** — typography, favicon, SVG/icon registry, windows, help, tooltips and states are Core assets.
8. **Responsive validation** — mobile/touch and desktop/mouse are both release gates.

## Shared engines

- PDF engine
- OCR engine family: Tesseract native, Tesseract.js, OCRmyPDF, optional/future adapters such as RapidOCR
- Image engine
- Symbology engine: QR, Data Matrix, Aztec, PDF417, Code128/39, EAN, UPC, ITF, Codabar
- Document/Office structural engine
- Tabular engine
- Markdown engine
- Signature services: visual signature, certificate signing, signature appearance, validation/trust backend

## Implementation sequence

### V3.0 — Core metadata + derived-app model
- [x] Git-linked build metadata resolver.
- [x] Derived-app catalog family.
- [x] PDF Sign initial TEST derivative.
- [ ] migrate all Studio manifests to declare `sourcePath`.
- [ ] eliminate UI hard-coded version/date strings.
- [ ] expose commit metadata consistently in About/footer/version views.

### V3.1 — Core responsive contract
- normalize breakpoints and touch targets;
- responsive windows/panels/sidebar/ribbon;
- phone/tablet test matrix;
- PWA/camera hooks for acquisition Studios.

### V3.2 — Shared engines adoption
- OCR service multi-engine registry;
- symbology service used by QR & Barcode + PDF;
- image service consumed by Image/OCR/Scan/PDF;
- document/tabular services adopted by all matching Studios.

### V3.3 — Studio refresh
- Image Studio as first Core reference;
- OCR Studio multi-engine;
- QR & Barcode Studio;
- PDF Studio convergence;
- Scan Studio acquisition/document-capture product;
- Code Studio developer scope kept separate.

### V3.4 — Studio Hub / launcher
- CURRENT / TEST / latest;
- global policy + per-Studio override;
- runtime health;
- capability and engine status;
- derived apps;
- read-only Assets/UX and demo galleries.

## PDF Sign as architecture test

PDF Sign intentionally exposes only:
- PDF input or preloaded URL;
- page preview/navigation;
- signature/paraphe presets from the shared personal profile;
- drawn/imported signature assets;
- current/all page scope;
- simple position and size presets;
- PDF output;
- escalation to full PDF Studio.

It reuses the PDF engine and Studio Core. PAdES/DSS remains an advanced PDF Studio capability.
